They lead cross-city rivals Manchester United by only two points in the overall standings, which means this finale match versus Swansea is a crucial one for Manuel Pellegrini's side.\\nThe predicted result is a tough 2-1 decision for Manchester City.\\nSwansea City starting lineup (4-3-3 formation): Fabianski; Naughton, Fernandez, Amat, Kingsley; Fer, Cork, Ki; Barrow, Ayew, Routledge\\n\\n\\nRead more: http://en.yibada.com/articles/122806/20160512/premier-league-2015-2016-swansea-city-vs-manchester-preview-prediction.htm#ixzz48QoVYryM\", 'Heung-Min Son came into this game with the unenviable task of filling Dele Alli’s shoes. Alli is out for the rest of the season after he was hit with a three-game ban for punching Claudio Yacob. Up until this point, Son has three goals on the year, but his impact has mostly been as a super sub. So when he got the call to start, it was up to him to impress his manager Mauricio Pochettino.\\n\\nAfter England and Spurs star Harry Kane put Tottenham up 1-0, Son did just that and scored to give his team a two-goal advantage.Next season will be Tottenham’s first in the Champions League since 2011 and, while Son started a lot of games in the Europa League, Son will be eager to show that he belongs in the Champions League as well. Needless to say, this goal puts him in Pochettino’s good graces.\\n\\nTottenham’s rise as a title contender has been one of the bigger surprises this season ? obviously not as big as Leicester ? and their midfield depth has been a big part of it. If Tottenham keep their core players from this year and are able to upgrade through the transfer market, they’ll be a team to watch out for next year.', 'SEOUL, May 10 (Yonhap) -- South Korean midfielder Koo Ja-cheol is likely to miss national team friendly matches in June due to a toe injury, his Seoul agency said Tuesday.\\n\\nKoo, who plays for FC Augsburg in the Bundesliga, was replaced by Raul Bobadilla in the 32nd minute during his team\\'s league match against Schalke 04 at Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, on Saturday after Schalke\\'s Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg stepped on his right foot.\\n\\nThe medical examination later showed the 27-year-old had a small crack on his right little toe, according to Koo\\'s agent Choi Wol-gyu.\\n\\n\"(Koo) needs to rest for four to six weeks,\" Choi told Yonhap News Agency via phone. \"Koo lamented that he is likely to miss the national team friendly matches in June.\"\\n\\n   South Korea will take on Spain on June 1 in Salzburg, Austria, and face the Czech Republic on June 5 in Prague. Head coach Uli Stielike previously said he wants to form the strongest team possible with players in top form.\\n\\nHowever, Choi said that Koo will be available for South Korea when the final Asian qualifying round for the 2018 FIFA World Cup begins in September. He added that the former Wolfsburg and Mainz midfielder has just injured a toe, not an ankle, which had been bothering Koo in recent years.\\n\\nKoo has scored eight goals in 27 matches for Augsburg this season, setting a career-high for a single Bundesliga season. He had seven goals last season with Mainz.', 'Heung-Min Son\\'s late cameo in Tottenham Hotspur\\'s 3-0 win over Manchester United on Sunday was, in microcosm, an apt representation of his season.\\n\\nAn almost successful dribble through the Red Devils defence was followed by tidy work maintaining possession soon after. He then smartly slowed things down in second-half stoppage time as Tottenham saw out their victory.A valuable and admirable contribution, but arguably not quite vital to a season in which?like that result?it is others who have led the way. Moving forwards, Son still has work to do justifying the ￡22 million transfer fee paid for him.\\n\\nThis is partly on the 23-year-old himself. But also partly on head coach Mauricio Pochettino still figuring out how and when he can best deploy the attacker.\\n\\nWhere both have got it right in 2015-16 can inform how they look to get more out of the player next season.\\n\\nFor Son himself, he can particularly pinpoint his productive initial spell in the Tottenham team. A timely interjection in the story of the north Londoners\\' season that balances out some of his leaner periods.\\n\\nAfter a winless August Spurs were in need of a lift, especially from an attacking perspective.Son played his part here in his debut away at Sunderland. Although withdrawn shortly after the hour mark, his direct and lively work helped establish the positive momentum that would ultimately help his team to a 1-0 win.\\n\\nThe next few weeks saw even more tangible examples of this. His scoring efforts were especially important given striker Harry Kane\\'s finishing troubles at the time.\\n\\nSon\\'s brace in the 3-1 win over Qarabag helped get Spurs\\' Europa League campaign off to a positive start. Then, a thrilling and explosive match-winning goal three days later against Crystal Palace further invigorated the confidence sparked by their preceding league win.\\n\\nA solid showing in the subsequent 4-1 defeat of Manchester City underlined the early impressions of an adaptable and versatile performer well suited to Pochettino\\'s attack-minded system. One imaginative and energetic while able to adhere to more disciplined requirements (by comparison there were times during those Palace and City games fellow new signing Clinton Njie was clearly reprimanded by Pochettino for not participating in pressing the opposition).\"Son is a player that we followed a long time,\" Pochettino said after the Palace win, praising how \"he is a player who can play with Harry [Kane], No. 9, No. 10, seven, 11, all different positions.\"\\n\\nThe injury Son suffered against Man City, keeping him out until November, undoubtedly disrupted his flow.\\n\\nBy the time he returned, others like Kane, Dele Alli and Erik Lamela were in welcome grooves shaping this impressive Spurs side\\'s play. It was harder for the South Korea international to make an impact when he was less required to do so. Correspondingly, Pochettino began toiling in his attempts to accommodate him on a consistently successful basis.\\n\\nThat indecisiveness has perhaps contributed to recent performances lacking direction and purpose.\\n\\nIndeed, Pochettino might have got a little more out of Son by re-emphasising his importance to the team with recognition of him as the go-to alternative to Kane.The vitality and confidence he displayed in his forward role against Qarabag has been occasionally utilised since?notably in combative efforts against Monaco in Europe and Leicester City in the FA Cup (scoring a fine goal in the latter). But more recently away against Fiorentina and Borussia Dortmund, the Argentinian handed the attack-leading responsibility to Nacer Chadli.\\n\\nOn paper using the Belgian\\'s greater physical stature made sense. But Son\\'s go up-top in the return leg against Dortmund showed where his greater energy may have been better suited against the sturdy Germans at least. Little came off for him until his consolation goal in the defeat, but he had given them much more to think about.\\n\\nWith that said, in other instances the player himself has lacked the urgency that characterised those good early impressions last autumn.\\n\\nSon did not capitalise on his recent starting opportunity against Liverpool, a bright opening giving way to sloppier involvement thereafter. His being replaced by the fit-again, more hard-working Erik Lamela for the Manchester United game was no surprise.As seen with his social media work for the club (see above), Son has taken to life at Tottenham and in England. Those around him have obviously warmed to a seemingly infectious personality too.\\n\\nHeading into next season, Son and Pochettino must work on maximising the similar enthusiasm that defines his best work on the pitch. Be it in establishing a more clearly defined role or better preparing him to augment others wherever he is required to.\\n\\nGet closer to that consistency and Son will be able to prove he was not just a luxury purchase, but one intrinsic to the development of this exciting Tottenham team.', \"Swansea City are represented in the latest Premier League team of the week that has been selected by BBC pundit Garth Crooks.\\n\\nActually Garth is now down as a 'Football Analyst' these days, a posh term for a pundit then!\\n\\nThe performance by Ki Sung-yueng in the four one victory over West Ham at the weekend at Upton Park was enough to earn them a place in the side alongside the other, in the opinion of the former Spurs striker anyway, most impressive performers in the topflight over the latest weekend.\\n\\nI think we'll already know ourselves, and not just based on the latest performance, why Crooks, we'll also not argue with it, selected Sung-yueng as part of his team but explaining his choice he told the BBC.\\n\\n'Where did Swansea's 4-1 win at West Ham come from? I thought Swansea had packed sun cream and flip flops as they had their minds set on warmer climes. It couldn't have been further from the truth. They were without Ashley Williams and Gylfi Sigurdsson so it was left to Ki Sung-yueng to mastermind Swansea's revival. The South Korean was involved in Swansea's first goal and scored their third. In fact, the finish was superb and put the game beyond West Ham who looked shell-shocked. Can anyone tell me what is going on at Swansea? I haven't a clue whether manager Francesco Guidolin is staying or going. What I do know is Swansea look like a team again so the sooner they settle the concerns surrounding the manager's future, the better.'\\n\\nIt's always good to see the club represented in this way, and well played to Sung-yueng for his recognition, but the most important thing about the weekend was of course the three points.\\n\\nFull Team:\\n\\nArtur Boruc (Bournemouth), Antonio Valencia (Manchester United), Wes Morgan (Leicester City), Virgil van Dijk (Southampton), Ryan Bertrand (Southampton), Ki Sung-Yueng (Swansea City), N'Golo Kante (Leicester City), Steven Davis (Southampton), Wahbi Khazri (Sunderland), Jermaine Defoe (Sunderland), Sergio Aguero (Manchester City).\\n\\nRead more: http://www.swansea.vitalfootball.co.uk/article.asp?a=446198#ixzz48QoIs9Gi\", 'Cardinals set-up man Seung-Hwan Oh had an excellent outing on Tuesday, striking out the side in the sixth inning.\\n\\nFantasy Impact: Oh is yet to allow a run out of the Cardinals bullpen this season, and has struck out five of the eight batters he has faced.

There was no posting fee due to Oh being a free agent. That was January 11, 2016. \\n\\nAfter the signing, Oh had to return to his native country to face charges of gambling, an entertainment which South Korea holds strict laws against for native South Koreans. There is only one domestic casino; and, large betting amounts are not allowed. However, there are 16 casino\\'s for foreigners only. Oh, along with former Chicago Cubs pitcher Lim Chang-yong and Oh\\'s former teammate, were charged under South Korean law. Oh was fined 10 million for betting heavily, a fine equal to $8,300 in the United States. Per the article from FoxSports.com - \"The Korean Baseball Organization earlier hit both players with half-season bans after prosecutors charged them for betting around 40 million won ($33,000) each at a casino in Macau in 2014.\" The ban imposed was for games played in South Korea only. Thus, Oh traveled to Japan to continue his career.\\n\\nAlong with taking care of his court fine, he awaited approval of his work visa, to return to the States. Finally, this past mid-week with visa in hand, OH and his agent along with a friend, arrived at Roger Dean Stadium yesterday. He joined in the informal workouts with the rest of the Cardinals early arrivals. That was after he had stepped off his flight of 14 1/2 hours. \\n\\nAfter his workout, he was asked about his familiarity being in the States. He stated that it was familiar simply because it was baseball. The threesome were going to scout living quarters after his workout and I\\'m sure with the assistance of the Cardinals organization. \\n\\nOh is expected to be in the bullpen for long relief, also, to help relieve some pressure off Kevin Siegrist and Seth Maness, both being heavily relied upon in the 2015 season.

I don\\'t believe, if I were the opposition, I would take 33 year old Oh for granted either. ', 'Tottenham Hotspur snapped up talented South Korean international Heung-min Son in the summer from German side Bayer Leverkusen.\\n\\nThe player cost, according to the Guardian, a sizeable sum in the region of ￡22 million and arrived with plenty of promise.\\n\\nHowever, despite showing real glimpses of his undoubted quality, Son has often found himself on the bench this season and has also had to battle with injury at time.\\n\\nNow he has had a stark warning from his international boss that he needs to be a regular to play for his country.Speaking to the Korea Times Dutchman Uli Stielike had this to say about the South Korea star ? and others who were not regular first-team starters:\\n\\n\"I am curious how they will turn out in transfers this summer.\\n\\n\"I have some expectations that those players (who are not playing regularly) may have more opportunities in new teams. It is very important for them to play regularly.\\n\\n\"I think calling up players who have not played as regular members for about six months to the World Cup squad wouldn\\'t be appropriate.\"\\n\\nSon certainly has some need to be concerned.\\n\\nHe has played just 920 minutes in the Premier League this season. Compared to his peers at Spurs that does not read well. Erik Lamela has played 1939 minutes whilst Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli have played 2491 and 2308 respectively.So the Korean needs to establish himself as more of a regular fixture at Tottenham if he is to secure himself a place in the national team in the years to come.\\n\\nIf not, it seems Stielike would like him to consider a Tottenham exit.', 'The Seattle Mariners have had an extremely busy winter, signing breakout and bounce-back candidates galore. It seems that for all the moves the Mariners have made, they still are not done. On Wednesday, the Mariners finalized an agreement with Korean star Dae-Ho Lee on a one-year minor league deal.\\n\\nThe deal might not be as exciting as a Chris Davis signing or even a Byung-Ho Park signing (which I am still baffled at why the Mariners didn’t try to sign Park), but first baseman Lee has the potential to truly break out in MLB in 2016. Lee is by no means a prospect at the age of 33, but the potential to be an impact player and even take the first base job for the next few years is there.\\n\\n\\nLee is an interesting signing for Jerry Dipoto, as he doesn’t exactly fit into what the GM has looked for this offseason. At 6-foot-4, 280 pounds, he doesn’t exactly scream athletic specimen, but he makes up for it with his discipline at the plate. He has hit over a .300 batting average in seven of his last 10 seasons, split between KBO and NPB (South Korea and Japan). His career batting line between the two leagues is .303/.387/.514, which is sure to take the significant hit all Japanese and Korean players have seen when entering MLB.\\n\\nLee is by no means guaranteed a spot on the major league roster, but he definitely shows the potential to either back up at first base or take a DH type role with the team. Lee has decent defense at first base, but with his size he is not bound to impress with his athletic ability on the field. The mix of mediocre defense with an amazing presence at the plate would seem like a nice DH option for the Mariners, but Lee has to prove that he can accomplish in the U.S. what he did overseas. Also, with the crowded outfield the Mariners have, Nelson Cruz is likely to make the transition to DH this season (although Cruz would wish otherwise).\\n\\nLee is a two-time NPB champion (2014-15) and a three-time NPB All-Star (2012-14) in just four seasons in the NPB (2012-15). While playing in the KBO, he was voted the MVP of the league in 2010. Although Lee is more of a power hitter (even with his contact numbers), he is hoping that his success overseas will translate favorably in MLB. This is despite the perceived notion that all Asian players have a drastic decrease in power when entering MLB.\\n\\nThe plateau for Lee’s skill set in MLB would compare to David Ortiz at this point in his career. Ortiz in his prime was considered the cornerstone of the Boston Red Sox’ offense during the 2000s. Ortiz still has the skill to play on a major league roster in a prominent role, but he is definitely on the decline, announcing his retirement after 2016 earlier in the offseason. Lee’s size and plate discipline resemble Ortiz closely though, as they both like to crowd the plate, shrinking the strike zone for opposing pitchers.\\n\\nLee will have to prove himself in order to make the big league roster, but it was reported that he has $4 million in incentives if he can do so. While it is highly unlikely that Lee will make a major impact in the start of the season, he does have a chance to take the platoon spot at first base from Jesus Montero. Montero is out of minor league options though, creating a bit of a problem if Lee did make the 25-man roster.\\n\\nConsidering it is a largely incentive-based contract, the Mariners got a huge steal with Lee. If he doesn’t produce, it will cost the Mariners next to nothing. If he does perform well, then Lee will earn the money he rightfully deserves. Adam Lind needs a right-handed platoon partner, based on his split numbers. Lee could easily step into that role and become a fan favorite in Seattle.', 'Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Ryu Hyun-jin left a training camp in Glendale, Arizona on Tuesday and rejoined the team. \\n\\n\"I returned to Los Angeles for the first time in three months,\" he said. \\n\\nRyu had surgery on his left shoulder last season and started the new season on the disabled list, staying in the training camp to focus on rehabilitation. \\n\\nIf everything goes well as planned, he will be able to make a return to the big league in mid-May or June.', 'Son Heung-min says he is waiting to be cleared by Tottenham to realise his dream of representing South Korea at the Olympic Games this year.\\nOnly three players over the age of 23 can be selected by nations for the Olympics and, with Son turning 24 in July, Korea need Spurs\\' permission to allow him to play in Rio de Janeiro.\\nHead coach Uli Stielike claimed in March that Son had not been selected for the national team during the international window as compromise for allowing him to feature in Brazil.\\nHowever, allowing Son to play would disrupt his involvement for the start of the next Premier League season, but the former Bayer Leverkusen forward is hopeful of representing his country.\\n\"We\\'re still waiting for the decision so I can\\'t say anything,\" he is quoted as saying by ESPN.\\n\"Why not [play]?

BVB played breathtaking football after a stuttering start to the game, as initially, the final touch in attack was lacking.\\n\\nThe Black and Yellows were the most impressive team on the first Bundesliga match-day of the new year, as their promising start shows that there is yet more to come from the Westphalians. Whether it will be enough to give league leaders FC Bayern Munich a run for their money remains to be seen, but the eight-point gap to third-place Hertha allows Dortmund look up the table for now.\", 'Tottenham Hotspur now have a 2-0 lead over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge as halftime approaches. Christian Eriksen again played a huge role in the build-up of the goal. This time he threaded a pass through to Heung-Min Son, who calmly beat Begovic to the near-post. This is going a lot more swimmingly than anyone thought it would have.', 'An injury to his foot in September’s 4-1 victory over Manchester City ruled Son out for the subsequent six matches however. His hot start was cut short, and in his place Erik Lamela solidified his spot and Dele Alli began his ascent.\\n\\nWhen he did come back, he found his chances at a starting berth diminished significantly. But for stints in which he was brought in to give Lamela a much needed rest, Mauricio Pochettino elected to stay with the hot hands.\\n\\nThough Alli’s suspension has granted Son a nice end-of-season streak of starts ? during which he’s scored twice in as many games ? it’s difficult to look back on this season as anything but a disappointment.Son recently revealed the fact that he shares this sentiment in an article with Ham & High.\\n\\n“This season I think [I’ve been] a little bit unlucky. I started well, got injured and then getting fit took a long time. I’m still getting [back to] 100 per cent. But I’m very happy because I enjoyed this year in Tottenham.”\\n\\nThe transfer fee Son commanded in his August move to Tottenham from Bayer Leverkusen amounted to as much as ￡23 million, making him the third most expensive transfer in the club’s history after Lamela and Roberto Soldado. Expectations were, needless to say, very high.\\n\\nAt 23-years-old, though, Son still has plenty of time to make his case at Tottenham. The club’s qualification for the group stage of next season’s Champions League will presumably mean a more heavily rotated squad, something that Son will inevitably benefit from.\\n\\nThe Champions League is familiar ground for Son. During his time with Leverkusen, he made sixteen total appearances in Europe’s premier international club competition, scoring three goals and setting up three assists. He’s thus well aware of the challenge and opportunity Tottenham have ahead of them.\\n\\n“It’s not an easy competition and we have to look forward, we have to work very hard,” he said. “There are many good teams, [some of the best] in the world. We have to be very focused and be very ready for the Champions League next season.”\\n\\nTottenham will also be occupied with a hopeful title hunt next season as they attempt to build on the surprise success of the current season. While it doesn’t appear as if Lamela or Alli are going anywhere, it’s easy to imagine Son getting more minutes as Pochettino attempts to keep as many balls in the air as possible.', 'Borussia Dortmund have signed South Korean full-back Park Joo-ho from Mainz on a three-year contract, the Westphalian club announced on their website on Saturday.\\n\\nPark, 28, who was signed by current Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel while he was in charge at Mainz in 2013, has made 44 Bundesliga appearances and been capped 26 times by his country.\\n\\nView image on Twitter\\n\\nThe former Basel defender\\'s arrival increases the likelihood of Germany international Kevin Grosskreutz leaving Dortmund this summer.\\n\\n\"Joo-Ho Park is a perfect addition to our squad at left-back,\\'\\' said Dortmund\\'s director of sport Michael Zorc.\\n\\nPark goes straight into the Dortmund squad to face Hertha Berlin on Sunday.', 'It was announced today by Daniel Kim of KBS Sports that the Minnesota Twins had placed the winning bid of $12.85 million to negotiate with power-hitting Korean first baseman Byung-Ho Park, who hit .343 with 53 home runs and 146 RBI playing for the Nexen Heroes last season. However, though the 29-year-old has talent, he won’t solve the Twins’ greater problems and, assuming that a deal can be struck between both parties in the next 30 days, will be a mere band-aid solution.\\n\\nFrom a money standpoint, submitting a bid for Park isn’t a bad decision on Minnesota’s part by any stretch of the imagination. Without factoring contracts that have yet to be determined via arbitration, the team’s payroll for next season is currently at $73 million, per Spotrac. It was at $106 million in 2015, well below the luxury tax threshold, and there is little to suggest that there will be a significant rise in it come 2016. In the case of Park, if no deal is struck, Minnesota gets it’s $12.85 million refunded and Park heads back to Nexen for next season. No harm, no foul. Long story short, the team can afford him.\\n\\nBut though Park could indeed be of a great help to a Twins’ team that went 83-79 in 2015, each win costing just under $1.3 million, he wouldn’t solve Minnesota’s problems overnight. The Twins tied for 12th in MLB with 696 runs scored, but ranked 26th with a team batting average of just .247 and 28th in on-base percentage (OBP) at just .305. Minnesota also ranked 18th with a team slugging percentage of .399 and 16th with 156 home runs.\\n\\nMuch of those numbers above can be attributed to Target Field, the Twins’ $545 million ($589 million in 2015) stadium that opened in 2010, putting an end to nearly three decades of Twins baseball at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. Consider this. In 2009, the Twins’ final year at the Metrodome, the team ranked third in batting average, 13th in home runs, fifth in OBP and ninth in slugging percentage en route to the AL Central Division crown. The following year, though the team made the playoffs again, Minnesota dipped to 19th in home runs, but stayed third in batting average and improved to second in OBP and seventh in slugging. Though improved, the dip in power was indicative that Target Field was not at all a hitter’s park the same way the Metrodome was, with only five players hitting double figures in home runs compared to six in 2009.\\n\\nWhich brings the conversation to the next point: despite Park’s talent, first base is currently occupied in Minnesota by three-time batting champion and former AL MVP Joe Mauer. Going back to 2009, local hero Mauer was the player fans came to see in Minnesota. That year, despite missing nearly a month of action to start the season, he led MLB with a .365 batting average while also slugging 28 home runs with 96 RBI as he manned the catcher’s spot. Teammate Justin Morneau handled first base and hit .274 with 30 home runs and 100 RBI, and it was expected that the two would continue to put up top production in the new stadium.', 'Ki Sung-yueng of Swansea City in the English Premier League fell due to a head injury in an away match against West Bromwich Albion on Tuesday. \\n\\nKi knocked heads with Stephane Sessegnon in the 42nd minute while trying to block a shot.

Park ? a 29-year-old who hit 50+ the past two seasons in Korea ? hasn't had the smoothest transition into MLB, which isn't all that uncommon. He's still hitting just .233. But things have been better lately. He had four hits in the last two games, including a homer in each game.\\n\\n[Join a Yahoo Daily Fantasy Baseball contest now]\\n\\nYou can see if Park can hit another on Thursday when the Twins play the Milwaukee Brewers.

His first homer of the season was measured at 466 feet by ESPN's Hit Tracker Online (the second longest of the season thus far). MLB's Statcast system had it at 451. Either way, it shows that when Park connects, watch out.\\n\\nAnother wonderful element of this story is how excited people in Korea get about Park's success.

The top two countries from each group will directly qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, while the third-place teams from the two groups will have to go through playoffs to book their spot at the tournament.\\n\\nSouth Korea will obviously try to qualify as among the top two teams in the group, for finishing third will mean some pressure-packed matches down the road.\\n\\nThe two No. 3 seeds will have to go through a two-legged playoff round, with the winner going on to meet the fourth-place team from the fifth qualifying round in the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF). The two-legged inter-confederation playoff is also home-and-away and will be played in November 2017.\\n\\nThough they receive one of the two top seeds for the draw, South Korea are still considered favorites to punch their ticket to the World Cup along with Iran out of Group A, based on their head-to-head records against other teams and their performances in the previous round.\\n\\nSouth Korea have marched into the final round as the Group G winner with a flawless record of eight straight wins, which also includes a 3-0 forfeit victory over Kuwait.\\n\\nSouth Korea, led by head coach Uli Stielike, are the only Asian Football Confederation (AFC) member to win all second round matches without surrendering a goal. They scored 24 goals and conceded none in the seven matches played, not counting the forfeited match versus Kuwait.\\n\\nAmong the opponents in Group A in the final round, Iran could present the biggest challenge for South Korea. The four-time World Cup participant ranked first in Group D in the previous round with six wins and two draws.\\n\\nSouth Korea have posted nine wins, seven draws and 12 losses against Iran, and have suffered 1-0 losses in each of their last three meetings. Their last encounter was in November 2014 in Tehran where South Korea fell 1-0 to the hosts.\\n\\nIn particular, South Korea have never won on Iranian soil, with two losses and four draws.\\n\\n\"It\\'s time for us to come back home with a good result in Tehran,\" Stielike said on Tuesday.\\n\\nIran also have several players who are playing or have played in Europe. Reza Ghoochannejhad of Charton Athletic and Sardar Azmoun of Rostov are considered the two dangerous forwards on whom South Korea should keep their eyes.\\n\\nSouth Korea have winning records against all the other nations in the group, raising their possibility to finish inside the top two.\\n\\nUzbekistan, ranked 66th, topped Group H in the previous round with seven wins and a loss. Their only blemish was a 4-2 loss to North Korea in Pyongyang.\\n\\nSouth Korea have collected nine wins, three draws and one loss against Uzbekistan. Their only defeat dates back to 1994. And South Korea also have never lost to Uzbekistan in the final World cup qualifying round, with four wins and two draws.\\n\\nUzbekistan have players who are familiar to the South Korean football fans.

The Taeguk Warriors have four wins, two draws and a loss against the hosts for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and have not lost since 1988.\\n\\nStielike should be familiar with Qatari players as he coached Qatari clubs for nearly seven years before taking over South Korea in September 2014.\\n\\nChina, ranked 81st, are looking for their first World Cup appearance since 2002. In the second round, they finished second in Group C behind Qatar with five wins, two draws and a loss.\\n\\nSouth Koreans have been also dominant against the Chinese, losing only once in their 30 meetings while collecting 17 wins and 12 draws. Their latest meeting was in August last year at the East Asian Football Federation (EAFF) East Asian Cup, where South Korea blanked China 2-0.\\n\\nSyria are 110th on the FIFA rankings, second lowest in the final round ahead of only Thailand. They were the runner-up in Group E behind Japan after marking six wins and two losses.\\n\\nSouth Korea have played Syria only six times and they have three wins, two draws and a loss. They last squared off against each other in 2010, when South Korea won 1-0.\\n\\nSouth Korea should seek to score as many goals as they can against Syria, which let in 11 goals in the second round, the most among nations qualified for the final round.\\n\\nThe tight match schedule could present more challenges to Stielike\\'s side than actual opponents.\\n\\nSouth Korea first host China on Sept. 1 before traveling to Syria five days later. They will then face Qatar at home on Oct. 6 and go to Iran five days later to play what could be the most difficult match in the final round.\\n\\n\"We need to collect points before going to Iran,\" Stielike said. \"It\\'s important for us to not have big pressure before playing the match against Iran.\"\\n\\n   South Korea will wrap up the first half of the final round by hosting Uzbekistan on Nov. 15. The second half will start on March 23, 2017, when they travel to China.

After two hits in his first two at-bats, his batting average had reached .300 for the spring.\\n\\nLee’s first hit came in the very first inning, as he stepped into the batter’s box as the fifth hitter (DH) with two on board against lefty Andrew Heaney and delivered a clutch two-out line drive single to left to give the Mariners a 1-0 lead.\\n\\nHe stepped into the batter’s box with two outs again in the third inning, but had to wait until the fourth to get his second hit of the day, as the first base runner got picked off to end the inning.\\n\\nThe Angels changed the pitcher to right-hander Joe Smith, and Lee greeted him with his first double to leadoff the fourth. He would later come around to score on Daniel Robertson’s two-out double.\\n\\nLee grounded out to pitcher Al Alburquerque in the sixth before being replaced by another designated hitter candidate Jesus Montero.\\n\\nLee is now 6 for 21 (.286) with one double, one home run, five runs and four RBIs.\\n\\nAngels’ Korean first baseman Choi Ji-man went 1 for 4.

Coach Uli Stielike knows exactly which teams they will face ― China, Iran, Qatar, Uzbekistan and Syria ― and when: it all starts on September 1, 2016, and ends September 5, 2017. Now he has to start thinking about his team.\\n\\nHis mission is simple: to finish in the top two in the group and as this is the World Cup, the boss will want to field his strongest team in every game. Some of the team\\'s best are in Europe.\\n\\nThere is the English Premier League trio of captain Ki Sung-yueng at Swansea City, Lee Chung-yong at Crystal Palace and Son Heung-min at Tottenham Hotpsur. There are more in Germany: Park Joo-ho at Borussia Dortmund, Hong Jeong-ho, Koo Ja-cheol and Ji Dong-won at Augsburg and Kim Jin-soo with Hoffenheim.\\n\\nMost of those would expect to be selected for the national team if fit but the coach has warned the Euro-stars that it won\\'t be so easy. He has told them that only those who play regularly for their clubs will be considered.\\n\\nAt the moment, that applies to few. None of the English-based stars are doing so. Ki was Swansea\\'s player of the season last time but injuries and the club\\'s struggles have seen him lose his regular-starter status. Son at Spurs is usually on the bench while Lee at Palace often struggles to get that close to the field.\\n\\nIn Germany, only Koo and Hong play often, with Ji injured and the two left backs, Park and Kim, not having played for a couple of months.\\n\\nObviously, players who aren\\'t regularly on the field can lose their form and sharpness. The ideal situation is for the overseas stars to play every week at a high level. It is better to be playing in the K-League than benched in the Premier League. Stielike is hopeful that some will move teams after the European season ends.\\n\\n\"I am curious how they will turn out in transfers this summer,\" he told reporters at Incheon International Airport after returning from the draw. \"I have some expectations that those players (who are not playing regularly) may have more opportunities in new teams. It is very important for them to play regularly.\\n\\n\"I think calling up players who have not played as regular members for about six months to the World Cup squad wouldn\\'t be appropriate.\"\\n\\nThe problem is an old one and every coach for South Korea has said a similar thing since Koreans started going to Europe in any kind of number. The promise or threat goes that players who rarely play in England or Germany will not play for Korea. It sounds reasonable, but when it comes down to it, no coach follows it up. If Stielike does, he will be the first.\\n\\nHe is also being a little disingenuous. Not only can the coach decide what constitutes regular, but he will be naming his roster for the first two games, against China at home and Qatar away, in mid-August when the European season is just starting. Nobody will have played.\\n\\nSix months after the start of the new season, when his deadline is looming, half the qualification games will already have been played. If results are good, nobody will care and there will no calls to change a winning Korean team. If results are poor, there will be pressure to change anyway.\\n\\nEven so, it is hard to imagine Ki, the captain and heartbeat of the team, or Son, its biggest star, being left out of any roster because they have not been playing regularly. It is unlikely to happen, appropriate or not.

He also missed a number of starts in 2014 due to injury, so he\\'s taken the mound just 26 times in the past two years. \\n\\n\\nHe also dealt with what Roberts characterized as \"normal soreness\" during a bullpen session just over a week ago. The first-year manager said that Ryu is about two weeks behind the rest of the pitching staff.\\n\\nRyu said there\\'s \"definitely no pain\" and rather just \"typical soreness,\" but the left-hander underwent his shoulder procedure last May, so this could potentially be problematic, or at least further delay his 2016 debut. After all, the Korean admitted after his surgery that he was aware of the labrum tear in his shoulder ever since he underwent an MRI about two years prior, so it\\'s safe to say that the shoulder was more damaged since he pitched for that long while injured. \\n\\nWhile the Dodgers certainly prepared for the worst-case scenario in terms of their entire pitching staff by re-signing Anderson and adding Scott Kazmir and Kenta Maeda in free agency, another prolonged absence from Ryu is going to cost them dearly. The 28-year-old, despite making only 56 starts in two MLB seasons, was awfully impressive over that span, going 28-15 with a 3.17 ERA, 1.20 WHIP and 293 strikeouts in 344 innings. \\n\\n\\nAside from Kershaw, he\\'s arguably the next best pitcher/left-hander on the entire team.\\n\\nNow that Anderson and Brandon McCarthy will more than likely miss at least half the season, the Dodgers will rely on a number of relatively unproven arms in Maeda, Alex Wood, Mike Bolsinger, Zach Lee, Chris Anderson and Ross Stripling to potentially make an impact in the starting rotation.\\n\\nThis is the last thing that the club needed after losing Zack Greinke to the Arizona Diamondbacks, but there\\'s still plenty of time to assess the long-term health of Ryu as well as the potential of those looking to help out the MLB roster heading into 2016.', \"The winter break came nine minutes too late for Borussia Dortmund, who lost their last match of 2015, 2-1, to Cologne after holding a lead for 64 minutes.

We have four days until we play -- we can relax and recover. We have to be really focussed and we have to win this game. We\\'re ready, I hope we win against Fiorentina.

With returning faces like Kevin Seigrist, Seth Maness, Trevor Rosenthal, and Jonathan Broxton, most experts knew that there are very few teams who can compete with the Cardinals in terms of bullpen production.\\n\\n\\nHowever, surprisingly, or not that surprising to Korean baseball fans, in the first month of the season, Seung-hwan Oh has emerged as one of the most reliable pitchers in this bullpen behind Rosenthal and Seigrist.\\n\\nIn 9 & 2/3 innings this year, which leads pitchers in the bullpen, Oh is 1-0 with a 1.86 ERA and 16 strikeouts. More impressively, he has a 0.93 WHIP.\\n\\nOne of the best traits for a quality relief pitcher is that he doesn't let the ball get put in play a lot and simply strikes out the batter, alleviating the pressure from the defense behind him. With the Cardinals having an especially weak defense behind him, what Oh is doing is even more impressive.\\nOh's strikeout percentage is probably the most fascinating. Having faced 37 batters this year, he has 16 strikeouts, giving him a 43% strikeout rate.\\n\\nWith the exception of his blemish in that marathon Cubs game after the long rain delay in which he gave up two runs (both runs came after Matt Adams missed a diving ground ball), Oh has been perfect on the season. He is also pitching in high pressure situations. In the nine games he pitched this year, six of them were in a game decided by 3 or less runs.\\n\\nOh adds his value to the bullpen as a very flexible pitcher who Manager Mike Matheny can count on in many different situations. Recently, in a game against the Cincinnati Reds, Oh pitched for 2 innings and didn't show any signs of fatigue, showing that he can eat innings up for the bullpen if need be. He has also pitched in the 8th inning role holding a lead for Rosenthal.\\n\\nOf course, the season is still young and we don't have enough statistics to truly tell how a pitcher will be in this league, especially one who has pitched in a different country for his entire career. However, with that being said, Oh has looked terrific. If he keeps up this level of success, General Manger John Mozeliak hit a homerun with this offseason signing.\", \"Borussia Dortmund host Wolfsburg on Matchday 32 of the 2015/16 Bundesliga season on Saturday.\\n\\nSince the hosts have long clinched a second-place finish and the Wolves only have an outside chance at playing in Europe next season?they're six points behind seventh place, currently held by Schalke, which will be enough to qualify for the UEFA Europa League qualifiers this season, because Bayern Munich and Dortmund play each other in the DFB-Pokal final?the intrigue of this meeting has to come from somewhere other than the league table.\\n\\nSure enough, it was a busy week for the Black and Yellows, who announced on their website on Thursday that team captain Mats Hummels has officially requested a transfer to Bayern. Saturday's match will offer fans a first opportunity to let their feelings be known.\\n\\nAs for Wolfsburg, a thoroughly disappointing season is coming to a close. Despite reaching the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League and playing Real Madrid tough, the Wolves can't be happy with their campaign. As Bundesliga runners-up last year and winners of the cup?beating Dortmund in the final?expectations for this campaign were high but never met.\\n\\nHead coach Dieter Hecking could be fighting for his job in the last few matches and tried to rally the troops in his press conference on Thursday:\\n\\nDortmund won the first meeting in November in dramatic fashion thanks to a last-minute winner from Shinji Kagawa, but they haven't performed the double over Wolfsburg since the 2011/12 season.\", 'Borussia Dortmund keep their perfect record alive to start the 2015-16 season -- but just barely. It took a winner in the third minute of stoppage time by Park Joo-ho to prevent BVB from drawing their opening match of the Europa League against FK Krasnodar.\\n\\nPavel Mamayev\\'s goal put the Russians in front 12 minutes into the match to debunk what Dortmund boss Thomas Tuchel had preached before the match: \"I expect us to be awake from the very first minute. I hope that we don\\'t need another wake-up call.\" But his starting 11 needed quite a while to gel against an assured Krasnodar outfit. Park, Adnan Januzaj, Gonzalo Castro and Roman Weidenfeller rotated into the field to give Julian Weigl and Shinji Kagawa a deserved break.\\n\\nIn the post-match news conference, Tuchel sounded a bit different than beforehand: \"It took a long time to find [our way] into the match. Our passing and body language looked sloppy and we had to get used to new personnel and positions.\"\\n\\nThe fact that Dortmund didn\\'t look as sharp as usual is also a testament to FK Krasnodar, who impressed with pressing resistance and a lot of calmness on the ball. But in the end the Black and Yellows made their superiority count and relied on a late winner to keep the three vital points at the Westfalenstadion.', 'CLEVELAND, Ohio ? The Indians made an aggressive bid to win the negotiating rights to South Korean first baseman Byung-ho Park last week, but lost out to the Twins. ESPN reported the Twins\\' winning bid was $12.85 million, but they must sign the right-handed power hitter within 30 days.\\n\\nThe miss on Park did not knock the Indians out of the Korean market. They have interest in right-hander Seung-hwan Oh, who is scheduled to visit the United States this week to talk to several big-league clubs. Oh, 33, is a set-up man/closer who has had a lot of success pitching professionally in Korea and Japan.\\n\\nOh, nicknamed \"The Final Boss,\\' has spent the last two years pitching for the Hanshin Tigers in Japan. Before that he pitched nine years in Korea. This past season in Japan, Oh went 2-3 with a 2.73 ERA and 41 saves. He struck out 66 and walked 16 in 69 1/3 innings.\\n\\nOh, 33, is 32-30 with a 1.81 ERA in 571 games in Korea and Japan. He\\'s saved 357 games, while averaging 10.7 strikeouts and 2.1 walks per nine innings.\\n\\nChris Antonetti, Indians president of baseball operations, said Tuesday that the Indians were primarily focusing on improving the offense this off-season. That is especially true following the news that Michael Brantley could miss part of April following surgery on his right shoulder.\\n\\nThe bullpen, however, could use some fresh arms. The Tribe\\'s pen posted the second-best ERA in the AL this year at 3.12, but going down the stretch it was clear that manager Terry Francona needed another option besides Bryan Shaw and closer Cody Allen.\\n\\nOh, unlike Park, is a free agent and does not have to go through the posting process. Korean outfielder Ah-seop Son is expected to be posted in the near future. The Indians have scouted Son, but it\\'s unclear if they\\'ll make a bid on him.\\n\\n', 'Sunderland face their second away game in the space of 72 hours tomorrow lunchtime, when the Black Cats look to build on back-to-back Premier League wins over fellow strugglers Aston Villa and Swansea, by adding to their points tally at fourth placed Spurs.\\n\\nAllardyce’s men travelled to London yesterday after a recovery session at their base in Cardiff and will participate in light training at QPR today, before the players face a video analysis session on the Spurs squad.\\n\\nBut while Sunderland’s medical team have been understandably cautious over fatigue levels, Allardyce believes the players will feel much fresher after the 4-2 victory at Swansea moved the Black Cats to within a point of the safety mark.\\n\\nAllardyce said: “Placebo-wise, we feel good now.\\n\\n“We don’t feel as tired after we’ve won, as we would have done if we’d lost.\\n\\n“We’ve got a bit of training today at QPR and the rest of it will be visually and tactically to look at on their iPads.\\n\\n“We’ve got some very tired legs that have to reinvigorate themselves.\\n\\n“But hopefully with that placebo affect, the brain will be telling them that they’re okay.”\\n\\nThe win at Swansea was Sunderland’s second in the space of a fortnight against one of their relegation rivals after the 3-1 victory over Aston Villa earlier this month.\\n\\nThat platform has eased the pressure on a trip to White Hart Lane, where Allardyce admits anything would be a “bonus” for third bottom Sunderland.\\n\\n“If we win at Tottenham, it wouldn’t be as big as winning at Swansea,” he said.\\n\\n“The games against the teams in and around you are the ones that are the real six pointers.\\n\\n“Any point against Tottenham is a bonus. It’s the icing on the cake.\\n\\n“Swansea and Villa were the big ones and we’re showing some mettle now because people tell me last season that the team went under in these games.\\n\\n“We’ve done back to back wins to close the gap.\\n\\n“If we can manage a few draws, then we can chip away at the points total further.”\\n\\nSpurs boss Mauricio Pochettino has the luxury of being able to shuffle his pack, with a deep squad that has coped with the demands of the Europa League this season.\\n\\nHowever, Spurs have showed themselves to be vulnerable on their own patch over recent weeks.\\n\\nSpurs suffered a late 1-0 defeat against second placed Leicester on Wednesday night, while second bottom Newcastle triumphed at White Hart Lane last month.\\n\\n“Tottenham now, with the squad they’ve got, are looking very healthy and productive, no matter what competition they play in,” added Allardyce.\\n\\n“They seem to have, for me, 23-24 very good players who can go in the team, come out and go back in again.\\n\\n“And they still seem to produce results in all competitions.\\n\\n“Whatever team faces us tomorrow, it’ll be very difficult to beat.\\n\\n“Our hope comes from Newcastle beating them recently on their own ground.\\n\\n“Occasionally, they’ve shown at home that they’ve been caught out.\\n\\n“I managed to catch them out there a couple of times at West Ham, as Newcastle did.\\n\\n“Let’s hope we can do something like that tomorrow.”\\n\\n\\n\\nRead more: http://www.sunderlandecho.com/sport/football/sunderland-afc/swansea-win-the-perfect-tonic-for-weary-sunderland-1-7675917#ixzz48Qs2OGwh', 'Byung Ho Park hit a home run against the Brewers last week in the series opener.\\nByung Ho Park watched a Cody Anderson four-seamer blaze past at 94 mph during the second inning Tuesday night, and got a read on its speed. After watching a curveball spin too low, he waited for the 1-1 pitch. Another fastball, virtually identical to the first, and Park was ready: He whipped his bat into the pitch and drove it deep to right-center field, arriving at second base with a leadoff double.\\n\\nA few minutes later, Park scored on a Kurt Suzuki single to give the Twins a 2-1 lead. It was a good sequence for the offense-challenged Twins, but also represented a minor milestone for the 29-year-old Korean: his first major league hit off an extreme-velocity pitch, something that’s becoming more common every year in Major League Baseball.\\n\\nMost scouting reports on Park, as he left South Korea to sign with the Twins last winter, noted his extraordinary power, his impressive bat speed ? and his inexperience against pitchers who throw in the mid-90s and above. Few pitchers in the Korea Baseball Organization, where Park hit 104 homers over the past two seasons, can hurl a fastball more than 90 mph.\\n\\nSo how is the transition to MLB levels of speed going? Well, it’s been a predictably slow start, but the Twins are heartened by their rookie’s progress.\\n\\n“I don’t know if I’d comment specifically on how he’s handling hard stuff ? it’s just that I see steady improvement, whether it’s on fastballs or breaking balls,” manager Paul Molitor said. “We’ve seen him hammer breaking-ball mistakes, but he hit a fastball away for a no-doubter [home run] to right field [on April 18]. He’s pulled some good fastballs.”\\n\\nPark has left little doubt that he can crush slower-speed breaking balls that hang in the strike zone. The South Korean leads the Twins with five home runs, including a couple that traveled more than 440 feet, and three of them came on sliders or curves traveling less than 80 mph. Wednesday’s cannon shot that pulled the Twins within a run of the Indians was off an 84-mph cutter. Only that opposite-field blast off Chase Anderson, the homer that particularly impressed Molitor, came on a fastball, timed at 90 mph.\\n\\n“Not necessarily am I trying to hit home runs off a hard fastball. It’s all about timing,” Park said through an interpreter. “Once you reach it, you can’t control where it goes. So I work on my timing as much as I can against the 95 mph fastballs. I would say I feel comfortable now.”\\n\\nProbably even better after Tuesday’s double. According to MLB’s pitchf/x data, Park has faced 60 pitches of extreme velocity (93 mph and above) this season. Of those, he has taken 16 for balls, 11 for strikes, and fouled off 17. He has swung and missed at only six. But of the 10 hard fastballs he has put into play, only that double off Anderson fell in for a hit.\\n\\nBy contrast, teammate Brian Dozier, even with a batting average of only .207, leads the majors in hits against 93 mph-plus fastballs, with nine. Miguel Sano owns seven, Eduardo Escobar six, and every Twins position player had at least one before Park. But four of Park’s 14 total hits have come on four-seam or two-seam fastballs timed at 90 or above.\\n\\n“I think everyone is kind of learning he’s a little bit of a guess guy. If he’s looking to hit a good fastball, he’s got the bat speed to do it,” Molitor said. “He’s jumped on breaking balls when he’s gotten mistakes, too.”\\n\\nPark agrees with his manager’s observation.\\n\\n“I wouldn’t say I’m a fastball hitter or a breaking-ball hitter, but more of my home runs [in South Korea] came on fastballs,” Park said. “Not all, but some I was sitting on a breaking ball because of the situation and the pitcher. That has happened here, too.”', 'Hyun-Jin Ryu remains shut down as he works his way back from shoulder surgery.\\n\\nOn Friday, Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts said he expected Ryu to throw a bullpen session this weekend. But Saturday morning, Roberts indicated Ryu was still being held back. Roberts insisted “it’s definitely not a setback,” but part of the team’s long-term strategy.\\n\\n“There is no date [for Ryu to throw his next bullpen session],” Roberts said. “But the staff had a built-in, back-off period, where they can back off and then pick it up again. But there’s no date when he’s going to start throwing again.”\\n\\nWhen camp opened, the Dodgers said they expected Ryu to pitch in a Cactus League game. Ryu himself revealed his goals were to join the team in May, make 20 starts and log 150 innings. Those milestones become less and less likely as he remains idle.\\n\\nRyu experienced soreness in his left arm after throwing a bullpen session on Feb. 26. He has not thrown since. At some point in the future, Roberts explained, Ryu will resume his throwing program.']\n"
